# Time-Efficient-Queries-on-a-CSV-File

In this project we aim to build fast queries that can be excuted on a CSV file in order to answer questions and conclude insights about the data being investigated.

Our approach is to create a class that represents our inventory, the class methodes represent the different queries we want to execute and in order to provide fast execution; preprocessing of the data will be implemented as well as using logarithmic search on sorted data.

For each of the following queries we will implement two different methods and later we will analyis both with respect to execution time.

- Get laptop from ID.
- Given an amount of money, find whether there are one or sum of two laptops which have price equal to that given amount
- Identify all laptops whose price falls within a given budget.
